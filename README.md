# high_school_java
Some of the programs from my high school that I found on my PC. Thought it would be a good idea to upload them on GitHub.

1. To execute them, clone the repository onto your local machine.
2. After cloning, just run the Control.java file using the command "java Control.java" in the command prompt opened in same folder.
3. Every other program in referenced in the Control.java file.

If I find more high school codes, I will definately add them to this repository and refer them in the Control.java

I will try to make use of this repository easier in the future.
Just sit tight.

Thanks!!
